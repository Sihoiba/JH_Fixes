# JH_QoL
Jupiter Hell mod to improve the quality of life with some of the mod pack, av and manufacturer perks which either don't do anything or don't work or actively hurt you.

## Changes

Better Perks
1. Autocalibration now gives melee weapons +10% damage and +10% crit instead of only +10% damage (and useless +1 optimal range)

Fixed to things that didn't work as expected
2. Sustain Mod perk gives Melee weapons a sustain perk that repairs 5% of armour on kill, instead of a perk that does nothing other than consume a mod slot and the rare mod pack.
3. Medifibre armour heals you with infinite durability if you apply an onyx pack, rather than onyx packing turning off healing.
4. Second chamber doubles the actual magazine size of the Drumlauncher, and microlauncher.
5. Second chamber perk when applied also adds ammo equal to the space gained, so it now does something with the EGLS Launcher.
6. Extended Mag perk now adds ammo equal to the space added so it now does something on the Magpistol and Magrail
7. FireAngel now correctly works - burns targets and ignites the floor - with beam weapons like the Vulcan. 
8. Necrotic armour will fully repair if it has the durable perk, rather than only to 50%

EGLS Launcher specific fixes
9. Loading Holster, makes the next shot taken after swapping to the EGLS launcher 10% faster rather than doing nothing.
10. Autoloader, makes the next shot fired from the EGLS Launcher after moving 10% faster rather than doing nothing.

Nailgun/Super Nailgun specific fixes
11. The Loading Feed perk will now only reload the Nailgun and Super Nailgun on move if they are empty and fully reloads the gun, instead of consuming a Repair Kit to reload 3-4 ammo
12. Gunrunner no longer reloads Nailgun and Super Nailgun until the weapon is empty.
13. Efficient weapon perk now gives Nailgun and Super Nailgun reduced shot cost instead of doing nothing.

Recharging exotic specific fixes
14. Efficient reduces shot cost of the CRI Blaster and PES Rifle instead of doing nothing

Item description clarity improvements
15. Added damage to Novabomb description.
16. Ancient Mod Pack description now tells you you cannot dismantle the weapon to get it back once used.

Rare mod packs on melee builds/AoB improvements
17. Nano mod packs applied to weapons that cannot be reloaded, e.g. the EGLS Launcher or that self recharge like the Blaster allow the weapon to be reloaded 1 ammo per reload. 
18. Nano packs can now be applied to melee weapons. If the weapon does not do pierce damage it makes the weapon pierce. If the weapon is already pierce adds 50% crit damage. Also makes large and non-blade weapons work with Tech Blademaster.

Pure Quality of Life improvements
19. Manufacturing ammo at an ammo terminal when you have scavenger trait will no longer convert the ammo to the type of the weapon you are holding as presumably if you chose a different ammo type it was because you wanted it.
20. Botscanner helmet perk now highlights robots in light grey rather than red to avoid getting confused between robots and when the only three enemies left on the map enemy reveal.
