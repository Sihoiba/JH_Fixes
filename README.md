# JH_QoL
Jupiter Hell mod to improve the quality of life with some of the mod pack, av and manufacturer perks which either don't do anything or don't work or actively hurt you.

## Changes
* Autocalibration now gives melee weapons +10% damage and +10% crit instead of only +10% damage
* MDF Perk now gives melee weapons +10% Guard rather than nothing.
* Sustain Mod perk gives Melee weapons a sustain perk that repairs 5% of armour on kill, instead of a perk that does nothing other than consume a mod slot and the mod pack.
* Medifibre armour heals you with infinite durability if you apply an onyx pack, rather than onyx packing turning off healing.
* Second chamber doubles the actual magazine size of the Drumlauncher, and microlauncher.
* Second chamber perk when applied also adds ammo equal to the space gained, so it now does something with the EGLS Launcher.
* Extended Mag perk now adds ammo equal to the space added so it now does something on the Magpistol and Magrail
* The Loading Feed perk will now only reload the Nailgun and Super Nailgun on move if they are empty and fully reloads the gun, instead of consuming a Repair Kit to reload 3-4 ammo 
* The Gun Runner master skill will now only reload the Nailgun and Super Nailgun on move if they are empty and fully reloads the gun, instead of consuming a Repair Kit to reload 3-4 ammo 
* Novabombs now list their damage in the description.
* Nano packs can now be applied to melee weapons. If the weapon does not do pierce damage it makes the weapon pierce. If the weapon is already pierce adds 50% crit damage. Also makes large and non-blade weapons work with Tech Blademaster.
